SPARQL is advantageous in both machine and human terms. In machine terms, it standardizes queries and supports only machine-readable vocabularies, enabling complex database interactions. In human terms, its use of English words simplifies triggering actions, enhancing accessibility and ease of use. Besides, SPARQL also extends database usability/versatility as it can query around/across different databases in a simple manner — this would particularly facilitate in-depth humanities research.

## The Ancient Graffiti Project  
###  permanence and sustainability
B  
The project overall looks very sophisticated. It has several affiliations and sponsorships, as well as a large group of contributors responsible for different sections of the project. While both factors contribute to its permanence and sustainability, the project overall looks not as active before 2020. Number of new members joined are not as many as before, and activities such as fieldwork are no longer conducted. The only updates is about research publications. In addition, it seems that the website is not secure. 
### openness or restriction of their data  
A   
The website is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, granting users significant flexibility to share, modify, and even utilize its content for commercial purposes, provided that proper attribution and permission are granted. Grafitti can be exported in EpiDoc/JSON/CSV forms.   
### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
A  
The interface is overall very accessible. Every section of the navigation bar has further breakdown, and when browsing Graffito there are also applicable filters and interactive maps (the reaction is a bit slow when seraching around the map, though). The epigraphic conventions is also appreciated, which facilitates accessors to easily identify basic Graffiti information. 
### connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
A  
The website has its unique URI, and on the right side of the webpage, there is a single section of Partner and Affiliated Projects, indicating to external URIs linked. In sections such as properties, every property has also been interlinked with their respective URI within the website.

### permanence and sustainability
C  
This website is also not secure, according to my browser. The website has its permalink, indicating that it is supposed to be enduring and stable. However, it cannot tell the website’s sustainability, as it also decides by maintenance and updates ——which don’t seem to have any, and the last update on Github is also 5 years ago. 
### openness or restriction of their data
B  
The website allows uses of data and images for non-commercial, personal use, which is fairly open. However, there is no file for downloading, let along machine-readable forms. All you can do is copy & paste. 
### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
C   
The website has, arguably, no front-end designs. The overall setting could be sometimes confusing — it achieves both simplicity (no design) and complexity (you have to go over several links to access the real content), however in an unpleasant way. Visualization only concerns with pictures, and honestly I cannot sense the editor’s intention to categorize himself as “person”. At least put some basic information about you.
### connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
C  
The website has its unique URI, and also extensively linked to others. However, as I suggested above, some ways of linking are not very effective and informative, and most data are not machine-readable.
