        <h2>Recent Anecdotes</h2>
        <P>Leia had a hard time in the past one year. Her husband and brother Yoda, unfortunately, was diagnosed a horribly invasive, inoperable cancer, and has been euthanized in Janurary this year. With the arrival of the breeding season, Leia soon began craving for a new partner. The center thus brought a new male Eastern Siberian Eagle Owl, Kansk, from another Owl Center in Cornwall.  </P>
        <p>However, Leia's life with her new partner is not harmonious at all. Because Kansk's inability of flying up to the high perch within the aviary, he only made it to a lower one, which is Leia's favorite area. Leia was of course very angry about that, and the two quickly engaged in a vicious scuffle. The keeper had nothing to do but separated them, but fortunately no injuries were found.</p>
        <p>I didn't see Leia on my last visit to the center. According to the keeper, he did make another attempt to get the two owls to stay together. But Kansk grabbed Leia's food as soon as he went in the aviary, causing Leia to hit him again in anger. Then the keeper decided to move Leia to another aviary for the time and let Kansk get used to Leia's aviary alone first. After four weeks, the keeper will move Leia to the aviary opposite her original home so that they can gradually get used to each other's presence.</p>
