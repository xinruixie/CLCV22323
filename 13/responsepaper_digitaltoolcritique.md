# Response Paper
Introducing Augmented Reality to archaeology has largely facilitated our exploration of museum and historical sites, providing us an alternative, yet more comprehensive perspective to look at the history. For museum, AR provides visitors a more personalized and interactive tour, which potentially helps them to pay closer attention to the exhibits and allows an enhanced impression on them. In some stances, it also stimulates children’s interest on cultural heritage with playful elements. For historical sites, AR contextualizes the heritage by replenishing its spatial elements and whatever features that may illustrate its significance, and as such brings a more enriched and immersive experience on the site. 

# Digital Tool Critique  
## Ancient Inscriptions from Israel/Palestine  
### permanence and sustainability  
A-  
The project has a group of professors from several universities and a larger group of alumni, which indicate it may have ongoing research, but only several people, not a very strong academic support. It also got the copyright to make its content protected. The latest update was in July 17th, 2023, could be counted as a quite recent update. The second latest was in July 14th, but it seems that we are not able to browse the content by time.
### openness or restriction of their data  
B  
The license used is CC BY-NC 4.0, which means users are allowed to share & adapt the content with credit for non-commercial use. However, it seems that those inscriptions and translations are not downloadable in any form. But the website does have a page explaining its copyright so that still makes sense.  
### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data  
A  
Very beautiful website, I suppose it uses a html template (the style really looks like those from a random front-end design website). The search tool is advanced and easy to use, everything functions as normal. Great to see there is an interactive map and pictures in posts. It would be better if they could add pictures for more inscriptions — a lot of them are not available yet. Yet I know how hard it is so I would not be harsh.  
### connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)  
A  
The website has its unique uri, and is also linked to related others (e.g., zotero for the complete bibliography, research page for related papers). It is hoped to also has certain degree’s interconnectivity.  

## The Oxyrhynchus Papyri
### permanence and sustainability  
A  
Part of University of Oxford and powered by Oxford Mosaic, and has a research team of six scholars. This has ensured the project’s sustainability and ongoing research. It also has partnership with several other universities. I’m not sure if they have sustainable funding support, but according to the current project, I guess it is at least ok until 2026.  

### openness or restriction of their data
B  
All those pictures are downloadable in jpeg format but no other forms. Some related essays are restricted.  
### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data 
B  
Very typical Oxford style website, which sometimes makes you a bit confusing. For example the location list, it is really not a good choice to make them expand in this way -- some of them are really long. So does the virtual exhibition. Those all have good attempts but do change the way of managing information.   
### connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)  
B  
It has its unique uri, and interconnects with several different parts inside Oxford’s official website (e.g., the department of classics), as well as other external websites. But it is hoped to have more links to some external websites with information that can help comprehend this project, rather than just university’s official websites.
