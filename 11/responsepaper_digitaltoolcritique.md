# Response Paper
Generally speaking, 3D modeling enables scholars to visualize and document complex archaeological data in a low-cost, time-saving way, which is difficult to achieve with analogue or traditional recording methods. In the meanwhile, it also improves in efficiency, accuracy, post-season analyses, interconnectivity with other relevant resources, and outreach capabilities, etc. In some cases concerned with items/sites that are at-risk of destruction, 3D-modeling also helps scholars to preserve them and study them without possible damages.

## Pompeii: 3D-Explorer  
### permanence and sustainability
A-  
Pompeii: 3D-explorer was initiated in 2003 an survived until today. Its project was completed by the collaboration of U of Ferarra, Popeii archaeological park, and Kacrya Family Foundation. This shows it has strong intellectual and financial backup. The site is also recognized by Google Arts and Culture. However, there is no clear clue about its recent updates. Everything seemed to be generally developed in its initiated year (and maybe several years after that). 
### openness or restriction of their data
A  
The website explicitly states that the data is open resource. The data’s license is CC BY-NC-SA. People can download the dataset via Open Heritage 3D, but requires basic info such as organization belonged. 
### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data  
B   
The visualization of this website is definitely good since this is about its major function. If you want to know about Pompeii further there is also a Lesson Plan. The ‘Resource’ section is however confusing, it seems that this section does not really lead to some resources. 
### connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)  
B  
The website has its unique uri, however is overall very brief and does not have many links to other websites or interconnect to many other parts of this website. If someone want to find more information about Pompii, the partner, Soprintendenza Archeologica di Pompeii’s website is a good place, but there is no indication about that, it is only listed in partners. 
## Searchable Greek Inscriptions (PHI)
### permanence and sustainability  
B  
The project seems to to an affiliation of The Parkard Humanities Institute, and it seems that the Institute is willing to keep supporting it. From David W. Parkard’s letter, the project’s intellectual support was made by several scholars, however now there is a need to find new successors. Also, as he stated, they have to look for new partners, so maybe their situations about funding and other supports could be a bit critical for now. The last update is clear-cut, on July this year, so we can see they are indeed still working on the project. 
### openness or restriction of their data  
C  
The website is open access but contents are not downloadable. In some sense, you can indeed get the content by simply copying it but there is no machine-readable version then. 
### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data  
C  
The way of using the website is basically understandable, but its classifications could be a bit too specific that users have to click several links to get the actual inscription content. The search tool only allows you to browse by regions and reference/ bibliography. There is also no visualization tools, which I think there should be, since the contents were essentially inscriptions.
### connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)    
D   
The website got unique uri, but does not link to others. In this case some “links” are rather confusing as they are also in blue like other working links, but in fact they are just words with nothing.
