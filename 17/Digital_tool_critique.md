## permanence and sustainability

B

While the “About” section states that this website is developed after the example of [dvlf.uchicago.edu](http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/), and the website has the suffix of uchicago, its financial & academic supports remain a bit unclear. It seems that this is a project run by a group of scholars of interests, and sometimes some of them bring supports from other universities. However, all of these cannot specify their permanence and sustainability. Important updates are posted regularly (every one year or two) since 2012, which proves that at least it is still active. 

## openness or restriction of their data

B

The website also does not specify its license or regulate the use of its contents.  Every entry is indeed downloadable, but only in txt format and you have to save before downloading.

## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data

B

No many designs, no visualization, the typesetting is very hard on the eyes; but easy to understand and use. Things could be a bit confusing when switching dictionaries —words on the side bar are sometimes in Latin and sometimes in Greek, even if it’s in the same dictionary. Good to have lists of abbreviation, but the place they appear is a bit unexpected. 

## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)

A

The website has its unique URI, but its connection to other URIs are mostly subtly embedded in long passages (e.g., the “About” and “TEXT” section). While these links do provide contents that extend our understandings on this topic, it is expected to adjust them to a more reasonable way. 

# OCHRE

## permanence and sustainability

A

A platform supported by UChicago and its scholars to ensure its academic updates, monitored by university library admin to ensure its security and accessibility (and the core data is backed up nightly). In recent years, it also received a huge amount of funding （i.e. $1.75-million), as well as other additional fundings from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. 

## openness or restriction of their data

B

Personal, limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license is granted, but it is not allowed to make adaptation or in business use. According to the terms of use it seems that some fees might be charged in using certain parts. 

## functionality of their interface and interaction with their data

A

The website has very tidy design and lots of functions, and apt visualizations. The platform per se also concerns with a wide range of data, including textual, numeric, visual, sonic, geospatial, etc. 

## connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)

A

Unique URI ✅ Connect to other URIs ✅ It connects to various other websites that is closely related to OCHRE, ranges from publications, collaborations, and projects built upon it. It would be better if we can access every project in the project gallery.
