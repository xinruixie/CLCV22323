# Explore (in ~200 words) the impact of artificial intelligence on academic research and education. Discuss both the opportunities and challenges AI presents in the academic setting, and consider how it may shape the future of learning and knowledge creation.
(This might be a discursive response) In light of circumstances of Religious Studies specifically (maybe also humanities subjects beyond), rather than those practical impacts such as help interpreting sacred texts and digital archiving, a relatively major impact at present could be the incorporation of AI, as a topic, into traditional religious research, which totally opens up a new field to step in. For example, this one I captured in Edinburgh Divinity School:

Suchlike incorporation, I believe, also frequently happens in other humanities subjects. But it seems to be particularly fit for Religious Studies, as they can be put together to contemplate some rather metaphysical questions, such as ethics, vision, divinity, eschantology, etc. —something that is beyond technological matters. While this is admittedly a current trend, some scholars who are doing this have no many prior exposure on AI or remain as “chairman” scholars of AI — I’m not sure if they really have a thorough understanding on this topic, or if they are aware of this as a potential criticism. While this new field could be very significant, even paradigm-shifting, its development for now is more like a merely trendy one that tolerates everyone’s attempt, including those are not in-depth. Opportunities and challenges in a broader sense like the overuse of digital tools, of course, also cannot be overlooked. While opportunities created could be very clear-and-cut (e.g., more jobs, more new fields, more scientific breakthroughs, etc.), its challenges are somehow unclear. For those seemingly predictable popular ideas like higher education institutions being replaced or students discussion/ essay writing becomes essentially a conversation between AI, it is, at least for me, hard to tell if this will really happen, or to what extent will it happen. Overall, the delineation between opportunity and challenge could be still very ambiguous, and the development of, and trends in AI evolve too fast to predict its future.
