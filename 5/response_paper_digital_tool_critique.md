# Response
Data normalization is a data management technique that aims to present data relationships in a more intuitive, efficient, and cohesive manner using tables or other relationship diagrams. The normalization process is progressive, typically involving three or more normal forms.

In the first normal form, all columns are supposed to be identical, and values in each cell of each column should be singular and indivisible. Building upon the first normal form, the second normal form requires that, in addition to meeting the conditions of the first normal form, a composite key should fully determine all other non-key components. This can be represented in tables as decomposed tables with the same composite key.  Lastly about the third form: above requirements of the second form, the third form further eliminates transitive dependency, i.e., those between non-key elements, so that all rest parts of the dataset are solely dependent on the composite key. This may be exemplified as further decomposed tables. 

# Digital Tool Critique
## Papyri.info
### permanence and sustainability
B  
The main page shows Papyri.info is “Produced by The Duke Collaboratory for Classics Computing & the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World” . This informs us it’s a collaborative project done by a group of scholars from different institutions. It also has several partners, such as APIS, DDbDP, HGV, etc, and a license under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0.

Another factor contributes to its sustainability is the fact that the database debuted in 2009 and is still accessible today. However, it seems that it has not been updated, including the blog, for a decade. This makes me question if those scholars are still responsible for this database (or how many of them are still working on it). There don‘t seem to have update in funding, neither. The latest funding information is in 07/08, which presumably won’t last until today. 

### Openness or Restriction of Data
A-  
Documents are basically free access, and Papyri.info also provides several download formats such as XML, RDF, JSON, etc. But for further actions, such as edit, submit, and publish documents, and collaborate with others, require an account. 

### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
B  
A basically understandable interface. The search is detailed and advanced, other sections on the directory are also easily identifiable. Images from sources like BerlPap and Bipab are also mostly very clear. However, the typesetting of the website overall is a bit old and untidy, with a typical style of ten years ago. This sometimes can be hard on the eyes.

### connectivity across resources**
A  
Papyri.info uses the unique URI, and also extensively links with other URIs(other projects website, scholar profile, essays, publications, etc.) on many pages. I think it also utilizes data normalization? ? Many links are effectively inter-connected, which facilitates relational search. 

## Perseus Digital Library 
### permanence and sustainability
A  
A long-lasted project, which could be traced back to 1985. It received lots of fundings from several parties, from the Annenberg/CPB project to NEH, NSF, to Tufts University and the University of Leipzig, etc. The overall copyright is held by Tufts University.

The latest news and updates was posted in 2022, and the in 2019, not very frequent but can indeed make people sense the continuity. 

### Openness or Restriction of Data
A  
It is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License, and explicitly stated in the ‘open source’ section that ‘The Perseus Hopper is an open-source project’. Also, materials are all downloadable in XML version.

### functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
A-  
Basic tools such as the search bar and other categorizations are easy to find and understand. For those who are new to this tool, there is also a comprehensive FAQ page answering basic questions. 

The Dictionary Entry Lookup and wordlist would be very helpful, as they allow users to search in different languages and apply many filters. When reading long texts, underlines automatically appear to help users focus as the cursor moves. For Collections/Texts, the library also allows advance search and display preferences for each entry. But still, some designs are hard on the eyes (e.g., font size of some texts is too small) 

### connectivity across resources
A  
Perseus Digital Library has unique URI, and a strong emphasis on interconnectivity. Link basically appears everywhere possible, directing to both other parts within the website or to some external site like The Perseus Catalog. Non-proprietary, machine-readable data(XML) are also everywhere, even for the directory.
