Data normalization is a data management technique that aims to present data relationships in a more intuitive, efficient, and cohesive manner using tables or other relationship diagrams. The normalization process is progressive, typically involving three or more normal forms.

In the first normal form, all columns are supposed to be identical, and values in each cell of each column should be singular and indivisible. Building upon the first normal form, the second normal form requires that, in addition to meeting the conditions of the first normal form, a composite key should fully determine all other non-key components. This can be represented in tables as decomposed tables with the same composite key.  Lastly about the third form: above requirements of the second form, the third form further eliminates transitive dependency, i.e., those between non-key elements, so that all rest parts of the dataset are solely dependent on the composite key. This may be exemplified as further decomposed tables.
