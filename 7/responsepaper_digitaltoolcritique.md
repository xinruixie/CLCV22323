#Digital Tool Critique
##Thesaurus linguae Latinae (TLL)
###permanence and sustainability  
A  
The project is strongly supported by eight German Academies and one learned society from each of the countries involved, and is funded mainly by The Federal Republic of Germany and the Free State of Bavaria, with other minor benefactors. The project also got the copyright Â© 2023 Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, which means contents of this website is secured and protected by this German academy. The most recent news was updated in September, 2023, and updates were regular,though not frequent, in past years.   
###openness or restriction of their data  
C
The project uses CC-BY-NC-ND, the most restrictive license under Creative Commons. This means we users can only share the content (still give credit to the original author) for non-commercial use, whereas creating derivative works and changing the original contents are prohibited. It is still "open", however, only because it does not charge fees when sharing its contents. According to the download page of the website, there is indeed a list of articles or tables available, however they are, obviously, not the repertoire.  
###functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
A-
The project has a very beautiful interface. The directory is clearly displayed on the left, with some subsections. The TLL open access search bar is ok, but not very advanced. It seems that you cannot freely earch some other parts of the website(e.g., news), neither. Visualisation is fine, pictures are inserted almost in every section of the directory, and texts are mostly presented in very clear pdf form. There is also a list of user tools. 
###connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)  
A
The project uses unique URIs, for example the URL link of the website. Both the interconnectivity inside this sites and connections to other sites are very good--links appear in everywhere possible and are easily identifiable with their blud color.

###permanence and sustainability  
D  
It is built upon WordPress (I also have one and I know how fragile it is!), with no funding no copyright, and no license. The frequency of update cannot be visualised on the webpage, but have to track its social media. 
###openness or restriction of their data  
B  
While all contents are freely browsed, this blog does not really have a license. The author also does not specify ways of download, but in some random pages, for example CE & Scholarship, there is a list of PDFs downloadable. For the rest of the website, I suppose the use and share of the data can simply be done by copy & paste. 
###functionality of their interface and interaction with their data  
B  
The general interface is simple and user-friendly. It seems that there is no text search bar, but the content overall is not much. The directory with very specific subsections is enough to make these contents clear-cut. Most pictures are supported by Pinterest, so it becomes a bit annoying when you have to save them (as a Pinterest account is required). But this is much better when comes to maps, as they are made by Google Maps. Besides, there are a lot of ads on the page that detract from the view.
###connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
C  
The website uses unique URIs. Connetions are also fine, with extensive links interconnect to other parts of this website, and several links to other URIs (e.g., university course page).
